# Darts2

It's like lawn darts, but with coconuts.  This is a clone of the original darts game I made using pygame.  Accpet this one is written in Java.

The main entry point is Main.java.

**_NOTE:_** You'll need Java 17 to be able to run this.

## How to play
* Left/Right arrows moves left and right
* Space bar is pause
* Escape key is quit
